    <h3>Hi, there!</h3>
    <p> My name is Tais, I am 31 years old, I'm married and I have two dogs.</p>
        <p>I've spent the first five years of my life after high school studying to get into medical school at the university. As it was taking too long and taking away my mental health with it, I've decided to get into Physiotherapy school at the university. At the university I've studied for about 6 years, actively participating an working on numerous projects, researches, seminars, congresses and even working on a university Physiotherapy clinic.<br>
        Then, for personal and family reasons, I've embarked on an IT journey. I've completed a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and I've been studing and participating in academic projects ever since, for now I've had more experience with Agile Methodologies, Project Management and Frontend development.</p>
        <p>As a person I am calm, friendly, smiley, lihgt spirited. I love being with people and learning about different cultures and life experiences! </p>
        <p>Here's what I look like</p>
